ModoðŸ§¯ is a documentation generator (DocGen) for the [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)ðŸ”¥ programming language.
It generates Markdown for static site generators (SSGs) from `mojo doc` JSON output.

[This example](https://mlange-42.github.io/modo/) shows a MojoðŸ”¥ package processed with ModoðŸ§¯ and rendered with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), to demonstrate ModoðŸ§¯'s features.

## Features

* Generates [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)ðŸ”¥ API docs for [Hugo](#hugo), [mdBook](#mdbook) or just [plain](#plain-markdown) Markdown.
* Provides a simple syntax for code [cross-references](#cross-references).
* Optionally structures API docs according to [package re-exports](#package-re-exports).
* Customizable output through [user templates](#templates).

## Installation

Pre-compiled binaries for Linux, Windows and MacOS are available in the
[Releases](https://github.com/mlange-42/modo/releases).

> Alternatively, install using [Go](https://go.dev):
> ```shell
> go install github.com/mlange-42/modo@latest
> ```

## Usage

Pipe `mojo doc` to ModoðŸ§¯:

```
mojo doc <src-path> | modo <out-dir>
```

Alternatively, use a file:

```
mojo doc <src-path> -o docs.json
modo <out-dir> -i docs.json
```

Get help with `modo --help`:

```
Modo -- DocGen for Mojo.

Modo generates Markdown for static site generators (SSGs) from 'mojo doc' JSON output.

Usage:
  modo OUT-PATH [flags]

Examples:
  modo docs -i docs.json        # from a file    
  mojo doc ./src | modo docs    # from 'mojo doc'

Flags:
  -i, --input string        'mojo doc' JSON file to process. Reads from STDIN if not specified.
  -f, --format string       Output format. One of (plain|mdbook|hugo). (default "plain")
  -e, --exports             Process according to 'Exports:' sections in packages.
      --short-links         Render shortened link labels, stripping packages and modules.
      --case-insensitive    Build for systems that are not case-sensitive regarding file names.
                            Appends hyphen (-) to capitalized file names.
  -s, --strict              Strict mode. Errors instead of warnings.
  -t, --templates strings   Optional directories with templates for (partial) overwrite.
                            See folder assets/templates in the repository.
  -h, --help                help for modo
```

## Output formats

ModoðŸ§¯ emits Markdown files.
These files need to be processed further to generate an HTML site that can be served on GitHub pages (or elsewhere).
ModoðŸ§¯ supports different formats to make this step easier, via the flag `--format`:

### Plain Markdown

Just plain markdown files.
This is ModoðŸ§¯'s default output format.

### mdBook

Markdown files as well as auxiliary files for [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook),
with `--format=mdbook`.
ModoðŸ§¯'s output folder can be used by mdBook without any further steps:

```
modo docs-out -i docs.json --format=mdbook
mdbook serve docs-out --open
```

### Hugo

Markdown files with front matter and cross-references for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
with flag `--format=hugo`.

You should first set up a Hugo project in a sub-folder of your repository.
Then, run ModoðŸ§¯ with the Hugo `content` folder as output path:

```
modo <hugo-project>/content -i docs.json --format=hugo
```

Further, in your `hugo.toml`, add `disablePathToLower = true` to the main section
to prevent lower case members (like functions) and upper case members (like structs)
overwrite each other.
Alternatively, run ModoðŸ§¯ with switch `--case-insensitive`.

## Cross-references

ModoðŸ§¯ supports cross-refs within the documentation of a project.
Absolute as well as relative references are supported.
Relative references follow MojoðŸ”¥'s import syntax, with a leading dot denoting the current module, and further dots navigating upwards.

Some examples:

| Ref | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| `[pkg.mod.A]` | Absolute reference. |
| `[.A]` | Struct `A` in the current module. |
| `[.A.method]` | Method `method` of struct `A` in the current module. |
| `[..mod.A]` | Struct `A` in sibling module `mod`. |
| `[.A.method link text]` | Method `method` of struct `A`, with custom text. |

Leading dots are stripped from the link text if no custom text is given, so `.mod.Type` becomes `mod.Type`.
With flag `--short-links`, packages and modules are also stripped, so `.mod.Type` becomes just `Type`.

Besides cross-references, normal Markdown links can be used in doc-strings.

## Package re-exports

In MojoðŸ”¥, package-level re-exports (or rather, imports) can be used
to flatten the structure of a package and shorten import paths for users.

ModoðŸ§¯ can structure documentation output according to re-exports using the flag `--exports`.
However, as we don't look at the actual code but just `mojo doc` JSON,
these re-exports must be documented in an `Exports:` section in the package docstring.

In a package's `__init__.mojo`, document re-exports like this:

```python
"""
Package creatures demonstrates Modo re-exports.

Exports:
 - animals.mammals.Cat
 - animals.mammals.Dog
 - plants.vascular
 - fungi
"""
from .animals.mammals import Cat, Dog
from .plants import vascular
```

> Note that `Exports:` should not be the first line of the docstring, as it is considered the summary and is not processed.

When processed with `--exports`, only exported members are included in the documentation.
Re-exports are processed recursively.
This means that sub-packages need an `Exports:` section too if they are re-exported directly,
like `fungi` in the example.
For exporting members from a sub-package (like `Cat` and `Doc`), the sub-package `Exports:` are ignored.

Re-exported modules (like `plants.vascular`) are fully included with all members.

[Cross-references](#cross-references) should still use the original structure of the package.
They are automatically transformed to match the altered structure.

## Templates

ModoðŸ§¯ relies heavily on templating.
With flag `--templates`, a custom templates folder can be specified to (partially) overwrite the embedded templates.
Simply use the same files names, and alter the content.
Embedded templates that can be overwritten can be found in folder [assets/templates](assets/templates).

Besides changing the page layout, this feature can be used to alter the [Hugo](#hugo) front matter, or to adapt the [mdBook](#mdbook) configuration file.
