ModoðŸ§¯ can run based on a [config file](#config-file) or [standalone](#standalone).

## Config file

A ModoðŸ§¯ project is defined by a file `modo.yaml`.
This file contains the complete configuration for commands `build` and `test`.
The content of the generated file is shown [at the bottom](#config-file-reference) of this page.

When `modo build` or `modo test` are executed in a folder containing a `modo.yaml`,
the file is used for configuration and no command like flags are required:

```{class="no-wrap"}
modo build
```

However, command line flags can still be used to overwrite the values that were read from the file.
As an example, this is how to turn off warnings for missing docstrings:

```{class="no-wrap"}
modo build --report-missing=false
```

All config file entries are also exposed as command line flags,
except for pre- and post-processing scripts (`pre-run`, `pre-build`, ...).

## Standalone

ModoðŸ§¯ can also be used without a `modo.yaml` config file.
If there is no such file in the current directory,
an empty configuration is used.
Command line flags must be used for any configuration:

```{class="no-wrap"}
modo build -i api.json -o docs/
```

## Config file reference

The code listing below shows the content of `modo.yaml` as produced by `modo init hugo`.

All **paths are relative** to the location of the file.

```yaml {class="no-wrap" filename="modo.yaml"}
